**JSON Data Serializer and Deserializer**

Jsonic is intended to be a high-level abstraction for JSON data serialization and deserialization. Jsonic is just a wrapper on top of Zig's `std.json` module. Along with some compile time type checks and code generation.

If you need more functionality or code coverage, Please create an issue at [**Jsonic Repo**](https://github.com/bitlaab-bolt/jsonic) and buy us some coffee.
